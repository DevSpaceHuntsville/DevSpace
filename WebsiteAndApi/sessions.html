            <h1>So, Are We Hearing This Year</h1>
            <p>
                We're so glad you asked.
                We have no idea.
                One of the things We wanted to do with this new format was invite smart people to talk about whatever they want to talk about.
                With this in mind, we have asked a few people to speak, but specificly said we did not what to know what they were going to speak about.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our hope is that we will get smart people saying smart things that will truly inspire and amaze everyone.
                Part of that amazement comes for the sense of surprize.
                As such, we don't know.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep an eye out for the <a href="/speakers.html">speakers page</a>, where we will share the list as they confirm their participation.
