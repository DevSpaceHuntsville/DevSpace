			<h1>A brief message about sponsorships and COVID-19</h1>
			<p>
				We are still hoping to have our conference on September 10-11 of this year.
				When we began to plan the event, the pandemic had not started.
				Furthermore, we were hopeful that we would all be able to return to normal activities by this time.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, there is now much uncertainty and doubt for a reasonable timeline for things at this point.
				We personally hope that things will be in a state where we can hold out conference as planned.
				We are also fortunate that no real contracts have been signed yet, so we have to opportunity to step away if the climate isn't right in early September.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have a plan for moving forward that allow people to express their support for attending the conference with committing funds.
				We want to be transparent with our potential sponsors with this information as we move forward.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the time being, we are still offering sponsorship and exhibitor opportunities.
				However, at this time, we will only require a pledge of your potential support.
				This will allow you to express your interest and lock in a specific sponsorship level without having to commit any funds at this time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once we have decided to fully proceed, you will be contacted in the order you contacted us to make final arrangements.
				We believe this is the best method to proceed with the current uncertainty.
				We appreciate your support during this time.

			<h1>Sponsorship opportunities are available</h1>
			<p>
				Ok, well, this is awkward.
				Sponsorship opportunities are <i>almost</i> available.
				We still need a few more tweaks to the sponsorship prospectus.
				However, last year's prospectus is <a href="https://devspacesponsorstorage.blob.core.windows.net/files/2019/devspace-prospectus.pdf">still available</a>.
				You can take a look at that, as it will mostly stay the same.
				If you want a head start, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:info@devspaceconf.com?subject=DevSpace%20Sponsorships">info@devspaceconf.com</a>.
				I'm a big fan of early worms getting the birds.
