			<h1>What is DevSpace</h1>
			<p>
				DevSpace is an annual developer’s conference that takes place in Huntsville, Alabama.
				Fueled by extensive space and missile research and a vibrant, emerging start-up culture, Huntsville is a market poised and ready to burst onto the national stage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Technological interests run the gamut of every language.
				As such, DevSpace aims to cater to this entire atmosphere.
				DevSpace wants to offer talks on a variety of languages, offering attendees the ability to improve their skills within their daily technology of choice and the ability to become familiar with new technologies.
				Combine this with talks on soft skills and processes, DevSpace will provide an outstanding value to the attendees.

			<h1>So, what's the deal with this year?</h1>
			<p>
				You may have noticed that 2020 is not exactly your typical year (and we'll just leave that as that.)
				In conventional times, we have to adjust for an unconventional conference.
				You may even say that we my convene unconventionally.
				No, just us? Alright...
			</p>
			<p>
				After much deliberation, we have made the decision to hold DevSpace as a virtual event this year.
				However, being the slightly off kilter people we are, of course it's going to be slightly unusual.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let us first get the most pressing question out of the way.
				Yes, it will be 100% free to anyone that wishes to watch and participate.
				No tickets, no anything.
				Just tune into the Twitch stream on September 11th.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, how will we make this stand out from every other conference that is moving to Twitch stream?
				Well, I'm glad you asked.
				(Ok, well, I asked for you, but I'm sure you were thinking it.)
				The speaker line-up for this year will be 100% hand selected, invite only.
				We plan on inviting interesting people in the tech world, and will allow them to speak about whatever they want.
				Yup, that's right, anything they want.
				We're even debating not asking them what they want to talk about, just how much time they need.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, how long will it run?
				At this point, we're not sure.
				It will depend on how many people accept our offer and the various time zone they live in.
				We'll have more details on that as we get a little closer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, everything comes with a cost, but ours is optional.
				As most of you are aware, DevSpace is a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit entity.
				We'll be doing this event as a "virtual telethon," and asking for 100% tax deductible donations during the breaks between talks.
				Yes, much of our normal budget goes to running the conference, but there are a few things that run outside of that.
				As such, we do need a little to keep the proverbial lights on.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, that's the quick version.
				We'll keep you all updated with details as we get more solidified.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<h1>Merch coming soon</h1>
			<p>
				A few of you have asked for it, so we're going to try to make it a reality.
				Details are still scarce at this point (even for us,) but we plan on making a few pieces of merch available in the immediate future.
				Right now we're looking at a good quality t-shirt and a sticker.
				If you have other ideas, let us know, and we'll see what we can get.
			</p>
			<p>
				For those curious as to why we never had the ubiquitous conference t-shirt, it's because we've never liked how they end up becoming walking billboards for 10 vendors.
				By running this t-shirt line outside of the scope of the conference, we can have better quality control and reduce costs.
				The t-shirts will probably be a timed pre-order, so we can only purchase what we need.

		<h1>Call for Sponsors and Speakers Open</h1>
		<p>
			Ok, I say our Call for Sponsors and Call for Speakers are open, but there is a catch.
			Please read the comments on the <a href="sponsors.html">sponsors page</a> and the <a href="speakers.html">speakers page</a> for more information.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, it's COVID-19 related.

	<article style="display: none;">
		<h1>Call for Sponsors and Speakers Coming Soon</h1>
		<p>
			Our call for sponsors will officially open soon.
			Basically, we just need a little time to update the sponsorship information to the new dates.
			If you'd like a head start, go to <a href="sponsors.html">the sponsors page</a> and look at the information from last year.
			I promise you, it will probably be mostly the same.
		</p>
		<p>
			While our exact dates for the Call for Speakers have not been decided, they will come soon.
			We usually would open the Call for Speakers during the month of May.
			With the conference moving up a month, we will surely have our Call for Speakers earlier that that.
			We don't want to commit to it being "the month of April" just yet, as there are a few backend changes we need to complete first.

		<h1>Dates for 2020 Announced</h1>
		<p>
			This year, the DevSpace Technical Conference will take place on September 10th and 11th.
			We will continue to be in the South Hall Ballrooms of the Von Braun Center.
			We have moved the dates from our traditional Friday and Saturday to Thursday and Friday.
			This was not a decision we took lightly.
		</p>
		<p>
			We posted an informal poll in several locations, such as on our Twitter account and various Slack groups.
			The split between people who enjoyed Friday and Saturday was dead split with people we did not want to attend a conference on a weekend.
			The biggest rationale for this was the belief that weekends should be for family.
			While we have plans to include a family track in the future, we currently do not have the budget to include that track.
			As such, we have decided to try a Thursday and Friday conference.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have also moved earlier into the year, opting for a September conference over our traditional October timing.
			Our primary reasoning for this came down to scheduling with the Von Braun Center.
			It can be difficult to find times that are available at the VBC.
			While we loved our mid-October time frame, we realize that we usually fell on top of fall break for all the local school systems.
			We had heard from many people that they usually make plans with thier families for vacations during this time.
		</p>
		<p>
			For those curious, we were given the option to have September 11th and 12th, and decided on the 10th and 11th as a combination of the two factors mentioned above.
			Besides, September 12th the start start of college football season.
			We were tired of competing against that, anyway.
